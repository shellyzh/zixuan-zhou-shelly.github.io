      title: '🤔 Fun Facts About Me'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I was born in Chengdu, the hometown of pandas and hotpots. Naturally, I'm a spice lover!

        I also love animals, especially parrots, because they're incredibly smart and expressive. My passion for climate science actually grew from realizing how profoundly climate change affects wildlife and biodiversity.

        My MBTI type falls between ENFJ and ENTJ—I thrive on connecting with people and taking the lead on meaningful projects. I'd love to get to know you, so please feel free to reach out and make friends! 😃
