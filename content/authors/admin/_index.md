      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi there!

I'm a climate and energy systems researcher working at the intersection of environmental science, economics, and energy systems. My research focuses on:

- High-resolution regional climate modeling
- Impacts of compound climate extremes (especially heat-drought events) on power systems
- Urban energy demand under changing climate conditions

I'm passionate about helping build more resilient renewable energy infrastructure in the face of climate change.

Always open to new collaborations and conversations! Feel free to reach out.
